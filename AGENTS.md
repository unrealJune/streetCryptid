# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code.

## Project conventions

- Package manager is **bun**. Use `bun install`, `bun add`, `bunx` — never npm/yarn/pnpm.
- Prefer the **just** recipes for common tasks (`just --list`). Run **`just check`**
  (typecheck + lint + format) before committing.
- Keep dependencies SDK-aligned: install native/Expo packages with
  `bunx expo install <pkg>` (not `bun add`) so versions match Expo SDK 57.
- Routes are file-based under `src/app/` (expo-router, typed routes). Import via the
  `@/*` → `src/*` path alias.
- `expo-env.d.ts` and `.expo/types/` are generated (git-ignored). Run `just start`
  once on a fresh clone before `just typecheck`.
- ESLint is pinned to v9 (eslint-config-expo@57's plugins are not yet ESLint 10 ready).
